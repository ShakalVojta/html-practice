    <h1>How do I see the differences between HTML and CSS?</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the difference between the usage of HTML and CSS?<ul>
            <li>HTML is used for structuring content on a webpage, while CSS is used for styling and formatting that content.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>What is the newest version of HTML?<ul>
            <li>HTML5 was the latest version of HTML.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>What are the top five most used HTML5 elements? If not sure, make a guess.<ul>
            <li>div: General-purpose container element.</li>
                <li>a: Anchor element for creating hyperlinks.</li>
                <li>img: Image element for embedding images.</li>
                <li>p: Paragraph element for defining paragraphs.</li>
                <li>h1 to h6: Heading elements for defining headings of different levels.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Have you checked out the HTML5 cheatsheet?<ul>
            <li>Yes, I looked and really enjoyed it.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>What is the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements?<ul>
            <li>
                Semantic elements convey meaning to both browsers and developers, aiding in document structure and accessibility, while non-semantic elements are generic containers without conveying specific meaning, often used for styling purposes.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Why do we prefer using semantic elements?<ul>
            <li>We prefer using semantic elements because they provide clear and meaningful structure to web documents, enhancing accessibility, search engine optimization, and facilitating easier understanding by both developers and browsers.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Do all browsers support all of the newest HTML / CSS elements?<ul>
            <li>
                Major modern browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge generally support the newest HTML and CSS elements. However, older versions of Internet Explorer may lack full support for some features. For instance, Internet Explorer 11 might have limited compatibility compared to more modern browsers.</li>
